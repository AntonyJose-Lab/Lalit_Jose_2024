This (dead) gene object exists as an attempt to make sure that a gene ID exists for every worm gene prediction that has ever existed....[050610 pad] Automatic assignment of Sequence_name connection using info taken from Public_name tags....This gene has been resurrected because it may be a member of a small gene family and should not have been removed....This gene was determined to be of Transposon in origin so has been removed from the C. elegans protein set. Detailed information about the origin of this gene can be found in the corresponding Transposon object associated with this gene.
