# Supplemental Table 2- The 'adr-1 adr-2 gene expression' tab lists genes with altered mRNA levels in adr-1(-/-);adr-2(-/-) worms compared to WT. All listed genes were statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05. There were 1,746 mRNAs increased and 1,571 mRNAs decreased ≥1.2-fold. The 'mRNAs targeted by miRNAs' tab includes information on mRNAs that are predicted targets of miRNAs. The 'Dicer Helicase dependent Loci' tab summarizes our re-analysis of data previously reported in (Welker et al. 2010), and includes all loci with a significantly different number of reads (p-value ≤0.05), as determined by Defined Region Scan Sequences (Nix et al. 2008). Only loci with ≥1.2-fold changes in the mutant strain compared to WT are reported.
