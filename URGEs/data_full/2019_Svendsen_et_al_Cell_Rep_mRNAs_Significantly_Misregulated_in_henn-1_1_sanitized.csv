"* Fold changes were calculated using DESeq2, which applies statistical methods to calulate a finite estimate for genes in which 0  reads were captured in the dataset and shrink imprecise estimates towards 0. As such, the fold change is not simply the ratio of  mean normalized reads. Reads mapping to multiple features were evenly split between each feature such that features with identical sequences will have the same numbers of reads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
