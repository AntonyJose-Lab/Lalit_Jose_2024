Remark: Map position created from combination of previous interpolated map position (based on known location of sequence) and allele information.  Therefore this is not a genetic map position based on recombination frequencies or genetic experiments.  This was done on advice of the CGC....This gene was determined to be of Transposon in origin so has been removed from the C. elegans protein set. Detailed information about the origin of this gene can be found in the corresponding Transposon object associated with this gene....Map position created from combination of previous interpolated map position (based on known location of sequence) and allele information.
