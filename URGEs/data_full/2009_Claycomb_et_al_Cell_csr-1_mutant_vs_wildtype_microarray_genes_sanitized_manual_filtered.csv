# Supplemental Table S6.  Tiling microarray expression data for Wild Type and csr-1(tm892) adult animals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# probe number - number of probes included in the gene,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Intensity - Intensity value obtained by geometric average for all the probes included in each gene. NA represents the absence of detected signal for a given gene,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Normalized Intensity - Intensity value divided by the total intensity for the actin genes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Ratio is calculated as: wild type/(wild type+csr-1(tm892)) using the normalized intensity value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# IP enriched - genes with a two fold increase for siRNAs in the CSR-1 IP are indicated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# over cut off - genes with >25 reads per million in the input sample or IP sample are indicated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# >10 probes - genes with signal for at least 10 probes in wild type or csr-1(tm892) are indicated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# germ line siRNAs - genes that are depleted over two fold for siRNAs in the absence of a germline are indicated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
