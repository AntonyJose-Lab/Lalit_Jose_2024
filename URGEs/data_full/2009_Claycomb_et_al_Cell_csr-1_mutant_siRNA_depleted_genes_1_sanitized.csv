# Supplemental Table S4.  Genes depleted over two fold in small RNA libraries generated from csr-1(tm892).  A list of 932 genes for which there were at least 25 small RNA reads per million (in the isogenic wild-type sample, DA1316), and that are depleted two-fold or greater of 22G-RNAs in the csr-1(tm892) library.
# Reads = number of reads antisense to and overlaping exon-exon juntions of the indicated gene, normalized to the number of times each sequence perfectly matches the genome.
# Reads - norm = reads per million, excluding reads considered to be degradation products
# Ratio is calculated as: DA1316/(DA1316+csr-1) using the normalized read -norm value
