# Analysis of coding loci targeted by 26G-RNAs in eri-5 and rrf-3 embryos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Coding 26G-RNA loci were defined in Vasale et al. (2010). The number of normalized antisense reads targeting the indicated 26G-RNA loci are presented as reads per million (rpm) for each sample. Enrichment values were calculated by dividing the mutant rpm value by the sum of mutant plus N2 wild-type (wt) rpm values. Highlighted rows indicate 45 coding loci with at least 10 rpm (total reads) in N2 or mutant sample; the corresponding enrichment values for 26nt reads (in bold) were used to generate the box and whisker plots in Figure 3C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
