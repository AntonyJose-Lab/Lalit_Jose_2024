# Genes differentially targeted by endo siRNAs in zsp-1(-) animals relative to wild type (WT). Endo siRNA pools in WT and zsp-1(gg682) animals were analyzed with DEseq2. Genes with differential endo siRNA pools in zsp-1(gg682) vs WT animals (adjusted p-value < 0.05 and log2 fold change ≥ 1 or ≤ -1) were included sheet2.
