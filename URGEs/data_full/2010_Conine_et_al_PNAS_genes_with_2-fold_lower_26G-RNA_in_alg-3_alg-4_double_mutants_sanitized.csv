# Supplemental Table S3 - Genes with two fold or less 26G-RNAs in the alg-3; alg-4 double mutant
# Wild type = Reads per million for each locus in the wild type sample
# TZK = Reads per million for each locus in the TZK mutant
# Ratio is calculated as: (alg-3; alg-4) / ((alg-3; alg-4)+ wild type) using the normalized read -norm value
