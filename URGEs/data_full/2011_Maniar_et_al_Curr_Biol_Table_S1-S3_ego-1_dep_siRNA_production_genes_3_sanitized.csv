Y75B8A.22,tim-1,"tim-1 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian timeless and Drosophila timeout proteins; in C. elegans, TIM-1 activity is essential for regulation of chromatid cohesion and thus, for proper meiotic and mitotic chromosome behavior and normal embryonic development; in addition, TIM-1 appears to also play a role in regulation of developmental timing, controlling the temporal identity of hypodermal seam cells during postembryonic development; during meiosis, TIM-1 activity is required for assembly of non-SMC members of the cohesin complex (REC-8 and SCC-3 in meiosis) onto chromosomes; immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that TIM-1 associates with mitotic cohesin subunits SMC-1, SMC-3, SCC-1, and SCC-3 in vivo, although TIM-1 is unlikely to be a core member of the cohesin complex but instead likely functions to regulate localization of non-SMC cohesin subunits to chromosomes; in mitotic cells, TIM-1 is present diffusely but most intensely in interphase nuclei and by the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, TIM-1 levels are much reduced and excluded from condensed chromatin; in germ cells, TIM-1 is diffuse in pre-meiotic nuclei, disappears abruptly as nuclei enter meiotic prophase, and then reappears in diplotene/diakinesis.
